## Project Overview
This project focuses on automating and streamlining the process of conducting manual checks in circuit manufacturing to ensure accurate component placement. This is to be done with computer vision systems by taking high resolution images of the printed circuit boards and using a machine learning model that will automatically locate, identify and verify the component placement. 

This specific project contains two sections which include image processing and component detection. For the first section,  I will be using OpenCV to mask the image of the motherboard, and in the second section, I'll be using YOLOv11 to classify components from a PCB.
